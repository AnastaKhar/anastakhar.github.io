     Acting is closely connected to graphic design. The way that actors create their characters, experience imaginary circumstances, and reflect the truths of the real world are all relevant to our practice.
     	<br><br>
	Magic If is an experimental collection of a fold-out poster and three books based on the interaction between design and acting. Magic If proposes a different way of going through a design process, taking into consideration similarities and differences between the two fields.
	<br><br>
	The books feature writings and exercises from theater and design thinkers along-side visual and conceptual symbols that represent ideas. Magic If is a playfully serious resource. It persistently poses a question about how and what choices we make affect how we act and create thoughtfully under imaginary circumstances.

          <a href="">Stanislavsky System</a><br>

The Stanislavsky system requires that an actor utilize, among other things, his emotional memory (i.e., his recall of past experiences and emotions). The actor’s entrance onto the stage is considered to be not a beginning of the action or of his life as the character but a continuation of the set of preceding circumstances. The actor has trained his concentration and his senses so that he may respond freely to the total stage environment. Through empathic observation of people in many different situations, he attempts to develop a wide emotional range so that his onstage actions and reactions appear as if they were a part of the real world rather than a make-believe one. Emotional recall is an important part of Stanislavsky’s method. Emotional recall is the process in which you try to recall a specific event in your past and relive it on stage through your character. Stanislavsky's principles: relaxation, concentration, communion, and commitment.

<a href="">Lee Strasberg (Method Acting)</a><br>
The goal was to produce a method of acting that would produce repeatable and consistent performances. His focus was on an actor's awareness of self and on his character's development, which is how some actors became famous for living their roles. That's not to say that astounding performances have not come from these Method Actors, but they do have a reputation for going to the extremes to prepare for their roles, including unnecessarily risking their health.
Acting is the most personal of our crafts. The make-up of a human being - his physical, mental and emotional habits - influence his acting to a much greater extent than commonly recognized. Lee Strasberg
<br><br>
<a href="">Meisner’s Technique</a><br>
The focus of the Meisner approach is for the actor to "get out of their head", such that the actor is behaving instinctively to the surrounding environment. To this end, some exercises for the Meisner technique are rooted in repetition so that the words are deemed insignificant compared to the underlying emotion. In the Meisner technique, there is a greater focus on the other actor as opposed to one's internal thoughts or feelings associated to the character.
"To be an interesting actor – hell, to be an interesting human being – you must be authentic and for you to be authentic you must embrace who you really are, warts and all. Do you have any idea how liberating it is to not care what people think about you? Well, that's what we're here to do." — Sanford Meisner
<br><br>
<a href="">Stella Adler Technique</a><br>
Adler understood the "gold hidden" inside the circumstances of the text. Actors should stimulate emotional experience by imagining the scene's "given circumstances," rather than recalling experiences from their own lives. She also understood that 50% of the actors job is internal (imagination, emotion, action, will) and 50% is externals (characterization, way of walking, voice, fencing, sports). To find what works for the character, the actors must study the circumstances of the text and make their choices based on what one gets from the material.
“Your talent is in your choice.”
<br><br>
<a href="">Michael Chekhov</a><br>
approach did not focus on emotional memory like Stanislavski's, but on imagination and movement. Admittedly, Chekhov employed many of Stanislavski's ideas in his teachings, however his stress on imagination, imagery, and physicalization were different than anything being taught at the time. Chekhov believed it was wrong for the actor to be restricted to using personal and emotional memories from his own life to understand and create a role. He did not understand why the actor could not use imaginary events and images to stimulate feelings. The substitute Chekhov used for emotional recall and sense memory was the creation of Atmospheres and Qualities. These were external expressions with movement, which provoked the feelings they mimed.  
<br><br>
<a href="">Practical Aesthetic Methodology</a><br>
Practical Aesthetics is an acting technique originally conceived by David Mamet and William H. Macy. Practical Aesthetics is based on the practice of breaking down a scene using a four-step analysis that entails the following:
1) The "Literal": The essential and most basic description of what is taking place.
2) The "Want": What does one character ultimately want the other character to say or do.
3) The "Essential Action": An evocative and relevant description of what the actor wants within the scene. It is essential to understand that what the character is doing and what the actor is doing are separate.
4) The "As If": This relates the "essential action" to the actor's own life.
<br><br>
<a href="">Uta Hagen</a><br>
Hagen advised actors to learn as much as possible about the character, to research everything related to the character's world. She also devised a series of exercises designed to make the actor more aware of his or her surroundings and wrote lists of questions for actors to answer.<br>
1. Who am I?<br>
2. What time is it?<br>
3. Where am I?<br>
4. What surrounds me?<br>
5. What are the given circumstances?<br>
6. What are my relationships?<br>
7. What do I want?<br>
8. What is in my way?<br>
9. What do I do to get what I want?<br>
The key to using the questions is specificity.

<a href="">Viola Spolin</a>
Spolin’s Theater Games are simple, operational structures that transform complicated theater conventions and techniques into game forms. Each game is built upon a specific focus or technical problem and is an exercise that militates against the artifice of self-conscious acting.
The playing (acting) emerges naturally and spontaneously; age, background, and content are irrelevant. The exercises are, as on critic has written, “structures designed to almost fool spontaneity into being” (Review, Film Quarterly, Fall/Winter 1963) By themselves, the games have liberating effect (accounting for their wide application in self actualization contexts); within the theater context, each clearly fosters a facet of performance technique. There are games to free the actor’s tension, games to “cleanse” the actor of subjective preconceptions of the meaning of words, games of relationship and character, games of concentration – in short, games for each of the area with which the growing actor is concerned. Key to the rubric of Spolin games are the terms physicalization (“showing and not telling”), spontaneity (“a moment of explosion”), intuition (“unhampered knowledge beyond the sensory equipment – physical and mental”), audience (“part of the game, not the lonely looker – onners”), and transformation (“actors and audience alike receive .. the appearance of a new reality”) To achieve their purpose, Theater Games need only the rules of the game, the players both actors and audience are considered to be players), and a space in which to play. Beyond the very tangible pleasures of “playing” which the games encompass, they also heighten sensitivity, increase self-awareness, and effect group and interpersonal communication. As a result, Spolin’s games have developed currency beyond actor training, that is, in encountering techniques, self-awareness programs, and nonverbal communication studies. Viola Spolin’s systems are in use throughout the country not only in university, community, and professional theater training programs, but also in countless curricula concerned with educational interests not related specifically to theater.

          <a href="">Design Process</a><br>
_ Who is the audience?<br>
_ What is the message?<br>
_ How many pages is the piece?<br>
_ What are the dimensions?<br>
_ Is there a specific budget?<br>
_ Is there a deadline for completion?<br>
_ Can the client provide examples of designs they like?<br>
_ Is there an existing corporate brand that needs to be matched?<br><br>

If a client isn’t able to see the needs of the end user, it’s the designer’s responsibility to explain what those needs are and why they should be considered and prioritized, and to suggest a process that considers the needs of that end user. Since many non-designers think of design as subjective, this teaching and modeling is a necessary part of the designer’s toolbox. And when designers work for more than one stakeholder—which is often the case—managing both the design process and the relationships within the group of decision makers is necessary to bring the design to completion.

Skills that can be automated and templatized become less valuable, while other skills become more valuable.

<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/overcrowded">The standard text on innovation advises would-be innovators to conduct creative brainstorming sessions and seek input from outsiders—users or communities. This kind of innovating can be effective at improving products but not at capturing bigger opportunities in the marketplace. In this book Roberto Verganti offers a new approach—one that does not set out to solve existing problems but to find breakthrough meaningful experiences. There is no brainstorming—which produces too many ideas, unfiltered—but a vision, subject to criticism. It does not come from outsiders but from one person’s unique interpretation.</a>
<br><br>
The alternate path to innovation mapped by Verganti aims to discover not how things work but why we need things. It gives customers something more meaningful—something they can love. Verganti describes the work of companies, including Nest Labs, Apple, Yankee Candle, and Philips Healthcare, that have created successful businesses by doing just this. Nest Labs, for example, didn’t create a more advanced programmable thermostat, because people don’t love to program their home appliances. Nest’s thermostat learns the habits of the household and bases its temperature settings accordingly.
<br><br>
Verganti discusses principles and practices, methods and implementation. The process begins with a vision and proceeds through developmental criticism, first from a sparring partner and then from a circle of radical thinkers, then from external experts and interpreters, and only then from users. 
<br><br>
Innovation driven by meaning is the way to create value in our current world, where ideas are abundant but novel visions are rare. If something is meaningful for both the people who create it and the people who consume it, business value follows.

<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-when-everybody-designs">Manzini distinguishes between diffuse design (performed by everybody) and expert design (performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they interact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported agriculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support these collaborations— making their existence more probable, their practice easier, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective.</a> 
<br><br>
<a href="">Collaboration in design process</a><br>
<a href="">Motivation<br></a>
The driving force for collaboration is motivation. In order for a collaboration to succeed, everyone involved needs to feel that they gain something from the collaboration or feel that they are doing a meaningful thing and working towards a valuable end result.<br><br>
<a href="">Communication</a><br>
In order to find the right people to collaborate with, the project needs to be communicated clearly. Giving information about the project and its goals helps people decide whether to participate or not.<br><br>
<a href="">Diversity</a><br>
Collaboration benefits from a wide range of skills and expertise in the pool of participants. A diverse group of participants is often the best way to ensure that this is achieved.<br><br>
<a href="">Sharing</a><br>
For a successful collaboration it is important to be flexible with the ownership of ideas. This does not mean that a team should not give credit to individuals where credit is due, but any issues of ownership of ideas or concepts need to be agreed at the onset.<br><br>
<a href="">Support</a><br>
The support of the other collaborators in the process is important, especially at times of crisis or unforeseen difficulties. Even when no hardships are expected, the collaborative group needs to work on the basis of the trust that if someone were to need the support of others in the group, that support would be available.<br><br>
<a href="">Problem solving</a><br>
The group must be able to solve problems together. High tolerance for uncertainty is needed when the project changes direction or something does not go as planned.

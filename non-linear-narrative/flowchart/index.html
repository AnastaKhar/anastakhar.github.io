<p><strong>ON MY WAY </strong> is about experiences I had getting to Parsons by subway this semester. I fall asleep on the train most of the time, and I decided to turn my trips into a story about my day-to-day adventure. The first image is my sketch of the story. After I finished sketching, I wrote the actions on the paper again, and cut out each one. Then, I mixed them all together, and placed them back on the paper in this random order. When I was reading it again, I felt like I'm reading a new story, that I have never read before. Then, I edited it a little bit, and created a flowchart in Illustrator. Most of the experiences are true, but some are imaginary. I have also created a moodboard, where I displayed images of the NYC subway, which I want to take typographic inspiration from.</p>

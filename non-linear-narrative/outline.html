<div class="paragraph">My story is going to be about a girl, who goes to the theatre with her grandmother, who is a performer. Girl’s curiosity leads her to getting lost backstage, and she had to overcome a set of emotions and challenges before she could get back to her seat. A theatre/backstage is a metaphor for life and it’s difficulties. This story is partially based on events that have happened to me sometime in the past, in combination with events that I wish would have happened. <br />
I tried to write a text of the actual story, inspired by the art of playwriting. The following is a beginning. <br />
“Spring. 16 degrees Celsius. White long-sleeve T-shirt, brown velvet skirt, white tights, sandals, and jean jacket. <br />
My grandmother and I are headed to the theater. She has a final rehearsal before the opening night tomorrow. I am as nervous as her, but for a different reason. She doesn’t want to forget her lines, and I don’t want to get lost backstage.<br />
A hallway leading to dressing rooms. The dressing room.<br />
Actors have just greeted my grandmother, and me. I am smiling, but I am too shy to say anything. I am trying try to take out a heavy laced cream dress from the cover to help my grandmother. Why is it so heavy, and rough? Dresses are supposed to be light and fun! As grandma is putting her dress behind the screen, I get more nervous. She is done, and we are heading to the stage. <br />
A crossover, a png hallway leading to the stage. The backstage. The stage.<br />
The director is already there, he greets us and tells a joke, as we come closer.”
